# ComicInfo.xml Standard (Proposed)

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to try and standardise the formatting of the common ComicInfo.xml file used by a number of programs and applications to provide metadata for Comics/Mangas/Manhwa etc.  A Github location for these version would also be helpful in codifying this proposed standard, and allow third party system to utilize them much easier.

## History
The history of this file stems from use in the application ComicRack, there has never been a defined strong standard definition of what should be contained in this file, there is at least two known versions, which have been included and tagged in this repository as 1.0 and 2.0

This file has been adopted by many downloaders, libraries and applications since it's inception, and some of these have made their own changes to it resulting in what can be a bit of a headache in its support in various different places.

## Proposal
### 3.0
The main goal of 3.0 is to try to move it further away from being tailored to Manga and more generic usage allowing potential adoption for comics, graphic novels and others.
